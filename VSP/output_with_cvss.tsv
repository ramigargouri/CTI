CubeFS prior to version 3.3.1 was found to leak users secret keys and access keys in the logs in multiple components. When CubeCS creates new users, it leaks the users secret key. This could allow a lower-privileged user with access to the logs to retrieve sensitive information and impersonate other users with higher privileges than themselves.

Then, in the following call graph:    ip_do_fragment()     ip_skb_dst_mtu()       ip_dst_mtu_maybe_forward()         ip_mtu_locked()  the pointer to struct dst_entry is used as pointer to struct rtable: this turns the access to struct members like rt_mtu_locked into an OOB read in the stack. Fix this changing the temporary variable used for IPv4 packets in sch_fragment(), similarly to what is done for IPv6 few lines below.

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52463	In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  efivarfs: force RO when remounting if SetVariable is not supported  If SetVariable at runtime is not supported by the firmware we never assign a callback for that function. At the same time mount the efivarfs as RO so no one can call that.  However, we never check the permission flags when someone remounts the filesystem as RW. As a result this leads to a crash looking like this:  $ mount -o remount,rw /sys/firmware/efi/efivars $ efi-updatevar -f PK.auth PK  [  303.279166] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000 [  303.280482] Mem abort info: [  303.280854]   ESR = 0x0000000086000004 [  303.281338]   EC = 0x21: IABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits [  303.282016]   SET = 0, FnV = 0 [  303.282414]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0 [  303.282821]   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault [  303.283771] user pgtable: 4k pages, 48-bit VAs, pgdp=000000004258c000 [  303.284913] [0000000000000000] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000 [  303.286076] Internal error: Oops: 0000000086000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP [  303.286936] Modules linked in: qrtr tpm_tis tpm_tis_core crct10dif_ce arm_smccc_trng rng_core drm fuse ip_tables x_tables ipv6 [  303.288586] CPU: 1 PID: 755 Comm: efi-updatevar Not tainted 6.3.0-rc1-00108-gc7d0c4695c68 #1 [  303.289748] Hardware name: Unknown Unknown Product/Unknown Product, BIOS 2023.04-00627-g88336918701d 04/01/2023 [  303.291150] pstate: 60400005 (nZCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--) [  303.292123] pc : 0x0 [  303.292443] lr : efivar_set_variable_locked+0x74/0xec [  303.293156] sp : ffff800008673c10 [  303.293619] x29: ffff800008673c10 x28: ffff0000037e8000 x27: 0000000000000000 [  303.294592] x26: 0000000000000800 x25: ffff000002467400 x24: 0000000000000027 [  303.295572] x23: ffffd49ea9832000 x22: ffff0000020c9800 x21: ffff000002467000 [  303.296566] x20: 0000000000000001 x19: 00000000000007fc x18: 0000000000000000 [  303.297531] x17: 0000000000000000 x16: 0000000000000000 x15: 0000aaaac807ab54 [  303.298495] x14: ed37489f673633c0 x13: 71c45c606de13f80 x12: 47464259e219acf4 [  303.299453] x11: ffff000002af7b01 x10: 0000000000000003 x9 : 0000000000000002 [  303.300431] x8 : 0000000000000010 x7 : ffffd49ea8973230 x6 : 0000000000a85201 [  303.301412] x5 : 0000000000000000 x4 : ffff0000020c9800 x3 : 00000000000007fc [  303.302370] x2 : 0000000000000027 x1 : ffff000002467400 x0 : ffff000002467000 [  303.303341] Call trace: [  303.303679]  0x0 [  303.303938]  efivar_entry_set_get_size+0x98/0x16c [  303.304585]  efivarfs_file_write+0xd0/0x1a4 [  303.305148]  vfs_write+0xc4/0x2e4 [  303.305601]  ksys_write+0x70/0x104 [  303.306073]  __arm64_sys_write+0x1c/0x28 [  303.306622]  invoke_syscall+0x48/0x114 [  303.307156]  el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x44/0xec [  303.307803]  do_el0_svc+0x38/0x98 [  303.308268]  el0_svc+0x2c/0x84 [  303.308702]  el0t_64_sync_handler+0xf4/0x120 [  303.309293]  el0t_64_sync+0x190/0x194 [  303.309794] Code: ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47115	Label Studio is an a popular open source data labeling tool. Versions prior to 1.9.2 have a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited when an authenticated user uploads a crafted image file for their avatar that gets rendered as a HTML file on the website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if a Django administrator visits the image.  The file `users/functions.py` lines 18-49 show that the only verification check is that the file is an image by extracting the dimensions from the file. Label Studio serves avatar images using Django's built-in `serve` view, which is not secure for production use according to Django's documentation. The issue with the Django `serve` view is that it determines the `Content-Type` of the response by the file extension in the URL path. Therefore, an attacker can upload an image that contains malicious HTML code and name the file with a `.html` extension to be rendered as a HTML page. The only file extension validation is performed on the client-side, which can be easily bypassed.  Version 1.9.2 fixes this issue. Other remediation strategies include validating the file extension on the server side, not in client-side code; removing the use of Django's `serve` view and implement a secure controller for viewing uploaded avatar images; saving file content in the database rather than on the filesystem to mitigate against other file related vulnerabilities; and avoiding trusting user controlled inputs.

To prevent the sk free, as a holder of the sk, ep should be alive when calling lock_sock(). This patch uses call_rcu() and moves sock_put and ep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe to try to hold the ep under rcu_read_lock in sctp_transport_traverse_process().  If sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still alive and we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false, it means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu_read_unlock, and we should skip it.  In sctp_sock_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep is different from tsp->asoc->ep, it means during this dumping, this asoc was peeled off before calling lock_sock(), and the sk should be skipped; If this ep is the same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means no peeloff happens on this asoc, and due to lock_sock, no peeloff will happen either until release_sock.  Note that delaying endpoint free won't delay the port release, as the port release happens in sctp_endpoint_destroy() before calling call_rcu(). Also, freeing endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk by asoc->base.sk in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv().

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.
